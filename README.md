Make changes to the Todo App and update UI:

1. Fetch Todo:
 A user should see a list of To-dos

2. Create a new Todo: 
A user should be able to add a Todo task with a title to the server and reflects on the App.

3. Update Todo status (Complete/Pending): 
A user should be able to check the box to indicate completed Todo task and uncheck the box to indicate pending Todo task.

4. And Delete : 
A user should be able to delete a Todo task from the server and also reflect on the UI that it has been deleted.

Every action is directly saved to the server.
